\section{Class of closed curves}
\label{sec-1}

Let us write
\[
\HS = W^{1,2}(\So \to \RR^2)
\]
and
\[
\HSnc = \HS \setdiff \lbrace \text{constants} \rbrace
\]
where \(\lbrace \text{constants} \rbrace\) denotes the constant maps \(\So \to \RR^2\).

For \(X \in \HSnc\), and \(V \in \RR^2\), write
\[
X_V = X + V \in \HSnc
\]
and define
\[
\alpha_X : V \in \RR^2 \to \frac{1}{2\pi} \int \frac{X_v}{|X_V|} \in \RR^2.
\]

Define the class of curves,
\[
\C = \lbrace X \in \HSnc : \int_{\So} \frac{X}{|X|} ds = 0 \rbrace = \lbrace X \in \HSnc : \alpha_X((0, 0)) = 0 \rbrace.
\]

The factor \(1/2\pi\) in the definition of \(\alpha_X\) has no effect on the class \(\C\) but is a convenient normalisation in the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:translate_C}
Let \(X \in \HSnc \backslash \lbrace 0 \rbrace\). Then there exists a \(V_0 \in \RR^2\) such that \(X_{V_0} \in \C\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First observe that since \(X/|X|\) has unit length, \(\alpha_X\), maps to the closed unit disc, \(\bar{D} \subseteq \RR^2\).

\textbf{verify continuity}

Next, the map \(\alpha_X\) is continuous and for any \(r, \varphi\) we have
\[
\lim_{r \to \infty} \alpha_X (r e^{i\varphi}) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int \frac{X + re^{i\varphi}}{|X + r^{i\varphi}|} ds = e^{i\varphi}.
\]

Moreover, for any curve \(\sigma(r)\) with \(\sigma\) asymptotic to \(r e^{i\theta}\) as \(r \to \infty\), we also have \(\lim_{r\to\infty} \sigma(r) = e^{i\theta}\). Thus the map \(\alpha_X\) extends continuously to the circle at infinity with \(\alpha_X(\infty e^{i\varphi}) = e^{i\varphi}\). Identifying \(\RR^2\) with the open unit disc, \(D\) we thus obtain a continuous map
\[
\alpha_X : \bar{D} \to \bar{D}
\]
which is the identity on the boundary.

But then \(\alpha_X(V_0) = (0, 0)\) for some \(V_0 \in D\) since otherwise the map \(V \mapsto \alpha_X(V)/|\alpha_X(V)|\) would define a retraction of \(D\) onto \(\So\) which is impossible.
\end{proof}

We will also need the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:projection_C}
For all \(X \in \HSnc\), there exists a \(V \in \RR^2\) such that
\[
\int \langle X, V \rangle ds = 0.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The map
\[
\beta_X : \varphi \in \RR \to \int \langle X, e^{i\varphi} \rangle ds
\]
is a continuous map such that
\[
\beta_X(\varphi + \pi) = -\beta_X(\varphi)
\]
and hence there is a \(\varphi \in \RR\) such that \(\beta_X(\varphi) = 0\). Then we take \(V = e^{i\varphi}\).
\end{proof}

\section{Min-max Construction}
\label{sec-2}

Let \(X \in \HSnc\) and \(V_0 \in \RR^2\) such that \(X_{V_0} \in \C\). The existence of \(V_0\) is guaranteed by Lemma \ref{lem:translate_C}. We define the following family of curves,
\[
\G_X = \lbrace v \in C^{\infty}(\RR \to \RR^2) : \exists t_0 \in \RR \quad v(t_0) = V_0, \quad \lim_{|t| \to \infty} |X_{v(t)}| = \infty \rbrace.
\]

For \(X \in \HSnc\) and \(v \in G_X\), let
\[
\lambda(X, v) = \sup \lbrace E(X_{v(t)}) : t \in \RR \rbrace = \sup \lbrace E(X + v(t)) : t \in \RR \rbrace.
\]

We have that \(\lambda(X, v)\) is finite since \(X_{v(t)}' = X'\) and hence
\[
\lim_{|t| \to \infty} E(X_{v(t)}) = \lim_{|t| \to \infty} \frac{\int |X'|^2 ds}{\int |X_v(t)|^2 ds} = 0
\]
as the definition of \(\G_X\) implies \(|X_v(t)| \to \infty\) as \(|t| \to \infty\).

Also from the definition of \(G_X\) we have for each \(v \in G_X\), the existence of a \(t_0\) such that \(X_{v(t_0)} = X_{V_0} \in \C\). Therefore
\[
\lambda(X, v) \geq E(X_{v(t_0)}) = E(X_{V_0}) \geq \lambda = \inf\lbrace E(X) : X \in \C\rbrace
\]
since \(X_{V_0} \in \C\) by definition of \(V_0\). Note that ovals have energy \(E = 1\) and Benguria-Loss ensures \(\lambda \geq 1/2\). Thus we have \(\lambda \in [1/2, 1]\).

Finally, define the min-max quantity,
\[
c = \inf \lbrace \lambda(X, v) : X \in \HSnc, v \in \G_X \rbrace.
\]
As noted, for any \(X \in \HSnc, v \in G_x\), we have \(\lambda(X, v) \geq \lambda\) and hence
\[
c \geq \lambda \geq \frac{1}{2}.
\]

It's also worth noting that \(E(X_{v(t)}) = 0\) for constant maps \(X\) and any \(v \in G_X\), which is why we work with \(\HSnc\) rather than with \(\HS\).

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:E_bounded_by_c}
For all \(X \in \C\),
\[
E(X) \geq c.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let \(X \in \C\), fix \(W \ne (0, 0) \in \RR^2\) and define
\[
v(t) = t W.
\]
Then \(v \in \G_X\) since letting \(V_0 = v(0) = (0, 0)\) we have \(X + v(0) = X \in \C\) and obviously \(|v(t)| = |t| |V| \to \infty\) as \(|t| \to \infty\).

Thus we have a variation \(X_{v(t)}\) of \(X\) with \(X_{v(0)} = X\) and \(\partial_t X_{v(t)} = W\). The first variation of \(E\) is
\[
\partial_t E(X_{v(t)}) = \frac{2\|X_{v(t)}'\|_{L^2}^2}{\|X_{v(t)}\|_{L^2}^4} \int \inpr{X_{v(t)}}{W} ds.
\]
The second variation of \(E\) is
\[
\partial_t^2 E(X_{v(t)}) = \frac{8\|X_{v(t)}'\|_{L^2}^2}{\|X_{v(t)}\|_{L^2}^4} \left(\int \inpr{X_{v(t)}}{W} ds\right)^2 - \frac{2\|X_{v(t)}'\|_{L^2}^2}{\|X_{v(t)}\|_{L^2}^4} \int |W|^2 ds.
\]
At a critical point
\[
\frac{2\|X_{v(t)}'\|_{L^2}^2}{\|X_{v(t)}\|_{L^2}^4} \int \inpr{X_{v(t)}}{W} ds = 0
\]
and hence
\[
\partial_t^2 E(X_{v(t)}) = - \frac{2\|X_{v(t)}'\|_{L^2}^2}{\|X_{v(t)}\|_{L^2}^4} \int |W|^2 ds < 0.
\]
Thus any critical point is a local maximum and there can be at most one maximum. We also have that \(E(X_{v(t)}) \to 0\) as \(|t| \to \infty\) hence there exists a global maximum, which occurs at the unique critical point.

Now, by Lemma \ref{lem:projection_C}, there exists a \(V_0\) such that
\[
\int \inpr{X}{V_0} ds = 0.
\]
Choosing \(W = V_0\) we see that
\[
\partial_t|_{t=0} E(X_{v(t)}) = \frac{2\|X'\|_{L^2}^2}{\|X\|_{L^2}^4} \int \inpr{X}{V_0} ds = 0
\]
and hence \(t = 0\) is critical point and the maximum occurs at \(t = 0\). Hence
\[
c \leq \lambda(X, v(t) = X + tV_0) = \sup_{t \in \RR} E(X_{v(t)}) = E(X).
\]
\end{proof}

\section{The Palais-Smale Condition and a Mountain Pass Theorem}
\label{sec-3}

The energy \(E\) has some undesirable properties that prevent us from characterising minimsers by employing the direct calculus of variations, or indeed obtaining the Palais-Smale condition.

First observe that \(E\) is not coercive, since \(E\) is scale invariant, thus while \(\lim_{r\to \infty} \|rX\|_{W^{1,2}} = \infty\), \(E(r X) = E(X)\) remains bounded. Thus we encounter difficulties in employing the direct method of the calculus of variations.

The next problem faced is that the energy \(E\) \textbf{might not quite be} Frechet differentiable since the map \(X \mapsto \|X'\|_{L^2}^2\) is not Frechet differentiable in \(W^{1,2} (\So, \RR^2)\). To see this, note that Frechet differentiability at \(X\) is the statement that there exists \(D'_X \in W^{1,2}\) such that
\[
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{D(X + h) - D(X) - \inpr{D'_X}{h}_{W^{1,2}}}{\|h\|_{W^{1,2}}} = 0.
\]
But we have
\[
D(X + h) - D(X) = 2 \inpr{X'}{h'}_{L^2} + \|h'\|^2_{L^2}
\]
so that for any \(Z \in W^{1,2}\),
\[
\frac{D(X + h) - D(X) - \inpr{Z}{h}_{W^{1,2}}}{\|h\|_{L^2}} = \frac{2 \inpr{X'}{h'}_{L^2} + \|h'\|^2_{L^2} - \inpr{Z}{h}_{W^{1,2}}}{\|h\|_{W^{1,2}}}.
\]
We have
\[
\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\|h'\|^2_{L^2}}{\|h\|_{W^{1,2}}} = 0
\]
since \(\|h\|_{W^{1,2}} \geq \|h\|_{L^2}\).

Thus if for some \(Z\), the limit exists and equals \(0\) we obtain
\[
0 = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{2 \inpr{X'}{h'}_{L^2} - \inpr{Z}{h}_{W^{1,2}}}{\|h\|_{W^{1,2}}} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{2 \inpr{X' - Z'}{h'}_{L^2} - \inpr{Z}{h}_{L^2}}{\|h\|_{W^{1,2}}}
\]
Thus for any \(V \in W^{1,2}\) with \(\|V\|_{W^{1,2}} = 1\) we would have
\[
0 = \lim_{t\to 0} \frac{2 \inpr{X' - Z'}{tV'}_{L^2} - \inpr{Z}{tV}_{L^2}}{\|tV\|_{W^{1,2}}} = \lim_{t\to 0} \frac{t}{|t|} \left(2 \inpr{X' - Z'}{V'}_{L^2} - \inpr{Z}{V}_{L^2}\right)
\]
which is only possible if
\[
2 \inpr{X' - Z'}{V'}_{L^2} = \inpr{Z}{V}_{L^2}
\]
for all \(V \in W^{1,2}\) with \(\|V\|_{W^{1,2}} = 1\).

In the particular case \(V' = 0\) we then obtain
\[
\inpr{Z}{V}_{L^2} = 0
\]
so that \(Z \perp_{L^2} \lbrace \text{constants} \rbrace\).

It's suggestive then to try:
\[
Z = \pi^{\perp}_{\text{constants}} (X')
\]
where \(\pi^{\perp}_{\text{constants}} : W^{1,2} \to W^{1,2}\) is the \(L^2\)-orthogonal projection onto \(\lbrace \text{constants}\rbrace^{\perp}\). Then \(X' - Z' \in \lbrace \text{constants}\rbrace\)

\textbf{We would like to prove}:

\begin{theorem}
\[
\lambda = 1 = E(\text{ovals}).
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let \((X_n, v_n)\) be a minimising sequence for the min-max quantity, \(c\):
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \lambda(X_n, v_n) = c.
\]
Also let \((t_n)\) be a sequence of real numbers with
\[
\lim_{n\to \infty} E(X_n + v_n(t_n)) = c.
\]

Define
\[
Y_n = \frac{X_n + v_n(t_n)}{\|X_n + v_n(t_n)\|_{L^2}}.
\]
Then \(\|Y_n\|_{L^2} = 1\) and
\[
\|Y_n'\|_{L^2}^2 = E(Y_n) = E(X_n + v(t_n)) \in [c-\tfrac{1}{n}, c + \tfrac{1}{n}]
\]
by passing to a subsequence if necessary.

Thus
\[
\|Y_n\|_{W^{1,2}} = \|Y_n\|_{L^2} + \|Y_n'\|_{L^2} \in [c+1-\tfrac{1}{n}, c + 1 + \tfrac{1}{n}]
\]
is uniformly bounded and hence there exists a weakly convergence subsequence
\[
Y_n \overset{W^{1,2}}{\rightharpoonup} Y
\]
as \(n \to \infty\). That is, for all \(V \in W^{1,2}\) we have
\[
\lim_{n\to \infty} \inpr{Y_n}{V}_{L^2} \to \inpr{Y}{V}_{L^2}, \quad \lim_{n\to \infty} \inpr{Y_n'}{V'}_{L^2} \to \inpr{Y'}{V'}_{L^2}.
\]

\textbf{Need to prove that \(\D_{Y_n} E \to 0\) in \(W^{-1,2}\) - Deformation Lemma!}

Using the fact that \(\D_{Y_n} \to 0\) in \(W^{-1,2}\), \(\|Y_n\|_{L^2} = 1\), and that \(\lim_{n\to\infty} E(Y_n) = c\), we have for every \(V \in W^{1,2}\) that
\[
\begin{split}
\inpr{Y'}{V'}_{L^2} - c \inpr{Y}{V}_{L^2} &= \lim_{n\to \infty} -\frac{2}{\|Y_n\|_{L^2}^2} \left[\inpr{Y_n'}{V'}_{L^2} - E(Y_n) \inpr{Y_n}{V}_{L^2}\right] \\
&= \lim_{n\to \infty} \D_{Y_n} (V) = 0
\end{split}
\]
as \(n \to \infty\). That is \(Y\) is a weak solution of
\[
\EL_c(Y) := Y'' + c Y = 0.
\]

But solutions of this equation are quantised, \(c = 0, 1, 2, \cdots\) with
\[
Y(s) = A_1 e^{i \sqrt{c} s} + A_2 e^{-i \sqrt{c} s}
\]
and we observed that \(c \geq 1/2\). Since the ovals have \(E = 1\), we may also assume that \(c \leq 1\), and hence quantisation implies \(c = 1\). Therefore
\[
Y(s) = A_1 e^{is} + A_2 e^{-is}
\]
has
\[
c = E(Y) = 1.
\]

Finally, by Lemma \ref{lem:E_bounded_by_c} we have
\[
\forall X \in \C, E(X) \geq c = 1
\]
and hence \(\lambda = 1\).
